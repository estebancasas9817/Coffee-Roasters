							We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good
							along the way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and
							brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source.
							To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly
							60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and
							opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with
							exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of
							farmers through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also
							offer training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in
							coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast
							each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native
							growing region.

							Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all
							stages of harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a
							rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking
							the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date
							and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly
							coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.
